# A-Algo

The A* algorithm is a greedy graph search algorithm that optimizes looking for a target vertex.
A* is a modification of Dijkstra’s done by adding the estimated distance of each vertex to the goal vertex when searching.
We can modify Dijkstra’s and turn it into A* by changing the following:
Adding a target for the search.
Gathering possible optimal paths and identify a single shortest path.
Implementing a heuristic that determines the likely distance remaining.
The runtime of A* is O(bd) where b is the branching factor of the graph and d is the depth of the goal vertex from the start vertex.
A* is an introductory glimpse into artificial intelligence.
